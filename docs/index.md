# Contract Module
This guide will explain you the basics of the *Contract* module.

## Overview

The *Contract* module enables simple personalization for customers.

The goal of this module is providing special prices for some Virto Commerce customers, such as non-tech, not high skilled business users.

The *Contract* module allows you to leverage both the *Pricing* and *Customers* modules in a single place.


## User Scenarios
The *Contract* module may come in handy for the following scenarios:

- Creating and managing contracts with customers
- Providing and managing special prices for specific products for specific customers
- Configuring contracts for specific contracting periods

## Creating New Contract
To create a contract, do the following:

1. Open the *Contract* module and click *Add*.
2. Give your contract a name and a description, specify the start and end date, and select a store.

> Only the *Name* and *Store* fields are required.

> You can change the contract name but not the code, which will be created according to the name.

> Only one store may be specified for a contract.
